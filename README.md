# if website still doesnt run
if the github upload fails again to deploy you can try to download the files to your workstation. Personally i used Visual Studio Code for HTML and JS, I used DBBrowser (SQLite) for building my Many to one database relationship, lastly, i ran server.js through my comand prompt. Once you build them on your workstation and run the server.js then open chrome and go to URL localhost:5000. If you download these files and build the path as descripbed in directory structure, you should be able to use java to manipulate the database in the ways directed by the project description.

Furthermore, the logic I used to write each file is written out inside the "Extended Description" in each file. Hopefully that can provide insight into why i wrote the code that i did, and i can be judged on the code i wrote, instead of being judged by the failure of github to deploy code.

# if githhub fails to deploy again, you can view the functioning userinterface at the javascript playground link below.
Because this website doesnt have databases, these are just the HTML files. All the buttons that should be using js files to pull data from database either just send an alert of what the code would be doing, or say undefined.
